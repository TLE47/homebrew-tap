# fbtodo — installed from the PyPI source distribution.
#
# This formula lives in the tap `TLE47/homebrew-tap`, at `Formula/fbtodo.rb`,
# which is what makes `brew install TLE47/tap/fbtodo` work (and, once tapped,
# `brew install fbtodo`). `packaging/homebrew/update-formula.py` writes the
# `url`/`sha256` below from the release that is actually on PyPI — see the
# tap's README for the two ways to fill them in.
#
# fbtodo has no Python dependencies, so there are no `resource` blocks: a venv
# is created and this source is pip-installed into it, which generates the
# `fbtodo` console script that the formula links onto the PATH.
